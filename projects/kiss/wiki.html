        <br><section class="intro"><p>The Kiss (in German Der Kuss) is an oil-on-canvas painting with added gold leaf, silver and 
            platinum by the Austrian Symbolist painter Gustav Klimt.[2] It was painted at some point in 1907 
            and 1908, during the height of what scholars call his "Golden Period".[3] It was exhibited in 1908 
            under the title Liebespaar (the lovers)[4] as stated in the catalogue of the exhibition. The painting 
            depicts a couple embracing each other, their bodies entwined in elaborate beautiful robes 
            decorated in a style influenced by the contemporary Art Nouveau style and the organic 
            forms of the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. The painting now hangs in the Österreichische 
            Galerie Belvedere museum in the Belvedere, Vienna, and is considered a masterpiece of 
            Vienna Secession (local variation of Art Nouveau) and Klimt's most popular work.[5].</p></section>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Love, intimacy, and sexuality are common themes found in Gustav Klimt's works. 
            The Stoclet Frieze and the Beethoven Frieze are such examples of Klimt's focus on romantic 
            intimacy. Both works are precursors to The Kiss and feature the recurring motif of an 
            embracing couple. <br> It is thought that Klimt and his companion Emilie Flöge modeled 
            for the work,[6] but there is no evidence or record to prove this. Others suggest the 
            female was the model known as 'Red Hilda'; she bears strong resemblance to the model in 
            his Woman with feather boa, Goldfish and Danaë.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gustav Klimt depicts the couple locked in an intimate embrace against a gold, 
            flat background. The two figures are situated at the edge of a patch of flowery 
            meadow that ends under the woman's exposed feet. The man wears a robe printed with 
            geometric patterns and subtle swirls. He wears a crown of vines while the woman 
            wears a crown of flowers. She is shown in a flowing dress with floral patterns. 
            The man's face is not shown to the audience and instead, his face is bent downward 
            to press a kiss to the woman's cheek, and his hands are cradling the woman's face. 
            Her eyes are closed, with one arm wrapped around the man's neck, the other resting 
            gently on his hand, and her face is upturned to receive the man's kiss. </p>

            <p>The patterns in the painting suggests the style of Art Nouveau and the organic 
            forms of the Arts and Crafts movement. At the same time, the background evokes the 
            conflict between two- and three-dimensionality intrinsic to the work of Degas and 
            other modernists. Paintings such as The Kiss are visual manifestations of fin-de-siecle 
            spirit because they capture a decadence conveyed by opulent and sensuous images. 
            The use of gold leaf recalls medieval gold-ground paintings, illuminated manuscripts, 
            earlier mosaics, and the spiral patterns in the clothes recall Bronze Age art and 
            the decorative tendrils seen in Western art since before classical times. 
            The man's head ends very close to the top of the canvas, a departure from 
            traditional Western canons that reflects the influence of Japanese prints, 
            as does the painting's simplified composition.
            <br>Klimt's father was a traveling artisan specializing in gold engravings, but 
            Klimt's use of gold leaf in paintings was inspired by a trip he made to Italy in 1903. 
            When he visited Ravenna he saw the Byzantine mosaics in the Church of San Vitale. 
            For Klimt, the flatness of the mosaics and their lack of perspective and depth only 
            enhanced their golden brilliance, and he started to make unprecedented use of gold 
            and silver leaf in his own work.
            <br>It has also been argued that in this picture Klimt represented the moment Apollo kisses
            Daphne, following the Metamorphoses of Ovid narrative.
            <br>Art historians have also suggested that Klimt depicts the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice. 
            More specifically, Klimt seems to be showing the exact moment when Orpheus turns around 
            to caress Eurydice and loses his love forever. As shown in this painting, the woman 
            being held is slightly translucent, indicating a fading away or disappearance—as told 
            in the story.</p>

        <h2>Reception</h2>
        <p>Klimt painted The Kiss soon after his three-part Vienna Ceiling series, which created a 
            scandal and were criticized as both "pornographic" and evidence of "perverted excess". 
            The works had recast the artist as an enfant terrible for his anti-authoritarian and 
            anti-popularist views on art. He wrote, "If you can not please everyone with your 
            deeds and your art, please a few". 
            <br>The Kiss was exhibited in 1908 in Vienna in the Kunstschau — the building created 
            in collaboration by Josef Hoffmann, Gustav Klimt, Otto Prutscher, Koloman Moser 
            and many others, to coincide with the celebrations in Vienna for the sixtieth 
            anniversary of Emperor Francis Joseph I's reign from June 1 to November 16 1908.
            <br>The Kiss, however, was enthusiastically received, and was purchased, still 
            unfinished, by the Austrian government when it was put on public exhibition.</p>

        <h2>References to The Kiss</h2>
        <p>In "The Freshman", the first episode of the fourth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, 
            several vampires display posters of The Kiss that they have stolen from students they 
            killed, remarking on how common it is as a dorm room poster.
            <br>In February 2013 Syrian artist Tammam Azzam superimposed an image of the painting 
            onto a bombed building in an unidentified part of Syria, in a work called Freedom Graffiti, 
            to call attention to the plight of war in his country.
            <br>In 2012, 20th Century Fox released the action/romance movie This Means War 
            starring Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hardy, and Chris Pine. The film features a scene where 
            Pine and Witherspoon's characters tour a private Klimt collection, with The Kiss being 
            the focal piece.
            <br>Altered Carbon, an American dystopian science fiction cyberpunk web television series, 
            also makes reference to the painting which the main characters find leaning against the wall 
            of an apartment in the far future.
            <br>The painting is also featured in the 1980 film Bad Timing directed by Nicolas Roeg 
            and starring Art Garfunkel and Theresa Russell.
            <br>In the 2004 anime Elfen Lied, the OP Lilium features many allusions to this painting
            and others of similar nature.
            <br>In the 2010 independent film Tiny Furniture, directed by Lena Dunham, there is a scene 
            in which the character Frankie (played by Merritt Wever) comments on freshmen moving into her 
            college dormitory, and she pokes fun at the ubiquity of The Kiss, exclaiming "...all the 
            collapsable hampers and mini-fridges and posters of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss."
            <br>In The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones episode Perils of Cupid, Indiana sees the 
            painting behind a glass display on the streets of Vienna.
            <br>The clothing company, Sock It To Me (clothing company), sells a pair of socks 
            titled, "The Kiss Knee High Socks," inspired by the painting of the same name.</p>
