    <p>“The beginning of my sophomore year, during, again, the [CMSC] 216, 250 time, after the second exam where I got, like, a 63 on, 
        and I did study, for about two nights, 12 hours in total, and I saw I wasn't getting the results for me and the expectations that 
        I wanted to, and I started reflecting, kinda starting to think — do I want to do this for the rest of my life?”</p>

    <p>Brandon Fung was a math-y, science-y kid. He was excited to go to a school with one of the best computer science programs 
       in the country — the University of Maryland. He still had that same passion for STEM his freshman year at this university. </p>

    <p>Then sophomore year came, with CMSC216, Introduction to Computer Systems, and CMSC250, Discrete Structures.</p>

    <p>Fung said some of the grades he received in those classes were “demoralizing.”</p>

    </div>

    <p>After still passing the courses, Fung decided to switch his major to Information Science in the winter of his sophomore year, 
       another popular STEM-inspired major, but less rigorous.</p>

    <p>“It's a lot better on my mental health because I'm not worrying as much on the exams,” he said. “Now I expect to pass, I expect to 
        get an A. And I usually do meet those expectations.”</p>

    <p>Erika Melder is a lecturer in the Computer Science department at UMD. Before becoming a lecturer, they received their bachelors' 
        in computer science and math at UMD in 2020, and completed an accelerated masters program in computer science the next year, 
        also at this university.</p>

    <p>“When you're in computer science in particular, and STEM overall, it's just such a huge slice of the university … there's a lot of 
        people who you compare yourself to so there's a lot of external pressure to do well,” Melder said.</p>

    <p>Melder tries to help their students in ways that their past professors wouldn't. They spend time in class doing problems 
       together with the students, and have a message board for outside of class when students have questions.</p>

    <p>They also hate the grading system that their professors used, and still use today.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>At the end of the semester, Melder explained, if students' grades are within one standard deviation of the class average, they pass. 
       If their grades are less than that, they fail.</p>

    <p>“It's too competitive. It's not a good measurement of how much you know. And it forces you to rely on other people doing poorly 
        on the assignment rather than yourself doing well,” Melder said.</p>

    <p>“The idea that, like, you're not going to school for your parents, like that became, like, really apparent to me. 
        And like, yeah, like I couldn't struggle through something that, like, I did not like or did not want to do in my adult life.”</p>

    <p>Joy Anyanwu used to be a computer science major at UMD. She had a lot of pressure from her parents, who are in medicine, 
        to enter the STEM field.</p>

    <p>Anyanwu spent her freshman year at home because of COVID-19, which she said made the computer science content even harder to understand. 
        There was little to no communication from her TA's as well as classmates, she said.</p>

    <p>The class size doesn't help either, Anyanwu said. Melder said they try to communicate with the students and the TA's to make 
        sure every student's individual needs are met. Their biggest class size is 300 students.</p>

    <p>After being in computer science for over a semester, Anyanwu switched her major to sociology in the spring of freshman year. 
        She said her mother didn't take the news well initially, but she slowly started to understand.</p>

    <p>“It's such a shift being able to go from absolutely dreading school to actually enjoying school, and the kind of weight that's 
        lifted off your shoulders. It's just indescribable, actually,” Anyanwu said.</p>

    <p>In general, many aren't happy with the environment that the STEM field inspires in college.</p>

    <p>“It's a really competitive environment, where students really just want to outdo one another,” Fung said.</p> 
        
    <p>Melder said they want to change the competitive environment that they felt as a student at this university.</p>

    <p>“The metric of my success is not me getting an internship. The metric of my success is me getting to study what I want to study,” Melder said.</p>
